# Multi purpose discord bot made by br4d#0040

This bot is the first proper bot that I have open sourced. I prefer to keep bots closed source due to the fact that I'm not a huge fam of people self hosting their own version of my bot that I spent alot of time and effort on. That changes today with Rada! If you're interested in self hosting Rada, there's information below on how to do so!

**Dependencies**
